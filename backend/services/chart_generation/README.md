- Provide customizable appearance options
- Optimize for performance and quality

**Integration Points:**
- Chart data providers (from calculation modules)
- Image manipulation libraries
- Font rendering systems

### North Indian Chart Style
Traditional North Indian (square) chart format.

**Implementation Requirements:**

### South Indian Chart Style
Traditional South Indian (diamond) chart format.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implement 12-house diamond layout
- Display planetary positions in appropriate houses
- Show house numbers and signs correctly
- Include strength indicators (optional)
- Support for custom annotations

**Integration Points:**
- Chart rendering engine
- Glyph and symbol libraries

### Chart Export Utilities
Tools for saving and sharing charts.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Export charts in various formats (SVG, PNG, PDF)
- Generate charts with different resolution options
- Create chart image metadata
- Implement caching for generated charts

**Integration Points:**
- File format conversion libraries
- Caching system
- Image optimization tools

## Implementation Notes

1. Chart generation should be efficient and optimized for server-side rendering
2. Implement caching to avoid regenerating identical charts
3. Ensure cultural accuracy in symbolism and layout
4. Use vector graphics where possible for scalability
5. Make chart elements customizable (colors, fonts, etc.)
6. Ensure proper text rendering for Sanskrit/Devanagari when needed
7. Consider accessibility features where applicable
8. Implement proper error handling for chart generation failures
