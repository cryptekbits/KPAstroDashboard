# Authentication Service

This directory contains authentication and authorization services for the astrology website.

## Components

### User Authentication
Core user authentication implementation.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implement secure login and registration
- Support email/password authentication
- Add social login options (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Implement multi-factor authentication (optional)
- Handle account recovery and password reset

**Integration Points:**
- User data models
- Email service for verification/recovery
- Password hashing utilities
- Session management system

### JWT Token Management
JSON Web Token implementation for API authentication.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Generate secure JWT tokens
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Handle token validation and verification
- Set appropriate token expiration policies
- Include necessary claims in tokens

**Integration Points:**
- User authentication system
- API middleware for token validation
- Secret key management system

### Role-Based Access Control
Permission management system.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Define role hierarchy (admin, premium user, regular user, etc.)
- Implement permission assignment to roles
- Support custom permissions for specific features
- Add role checking middleware for API endpoints
- Enable flexible permission policies

**Integration Points:**
- User profile data
- API route handlers
- Admin management interface

### Session Management
User session handling.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Track active user sessions
- Support concurrent sessions (optional)
- Implement session timeout and renewal
- Provide session invalidation (logout)
- Add device tracking for security

**Integration Points:**
- JWT token system
- User data models
- Session storage system

### Security Features
Additional security implementations.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Add IP-based blocking for suspicious activities
- Log authentication events for auditing
- Support secure headers and CORS policies
- Implement CSRF protection

**Integration Points:**
- API middleware system
- Logging service
- Security monitoring system

### Account Management
User account operations.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implement account creation and deletion
- Add email verification workflow
- Support profile updates and modification
- Handle subscription and payment status
- Implement account suspension and restoration

**Integration Points:**
- User data models
- Email notification service
- Payment service (if applicable)

## Utility Functions

### Password Utilities
- Secure password hashing and verification
- Password strength validation
- Password history management (optional)
- Secure random token generation

### Authentication Helpers
- Login attempt tracking
- Session identifier generation
- Token parsing and validation helpers
- Authentication status checking

### Security Helpers
- IP address validation and checking
- Request validation utilities
- Security headers generation
- Input sanitization helpers

## Implementation Notes

1. Security is critical - follow OWASP security best practices
2. All authentication routes should use HTTPS
3. Sensitive data should never be logged or exposed
4. Token lifetimes should be appropriate for the application's security needs
5. Consider using established libraries for critical security components
6. Implement proper error handling with non-revealing error messages
7. Add comprehensive logging for security events
8. Consider implementing API key authentication for machine-to-machine communication
