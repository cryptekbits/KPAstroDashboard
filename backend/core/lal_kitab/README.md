# Lal Kitab Core Component

This directory contains the core calculation components for Lal Kitab astrology system.

## Overview

Lal Kitab ("Red Book") is a unique form of Vedic astrology that originated in Punjab, India, combining traditional Vedic principles with Persian and Uranian astrological influences. Known for its simple yet effective remedies and distinctive interpretation systems, Lal Kitab focuses on planetary placements without considering aspects or conjunctions in the traditional sense. This module implements the specialized calculations, analysis, and remedial techniques of the Lal Kitab system.

## Usage Examples

```python
# Example (conceptual): Working with Lal Kitab charts and remedies
from backend.core.lal_kitab import LalKitabCalculator
from backend.core.chart import BirthChart

# Create a birth chart instance
chart = BirthChart(datetime="1990-01-01T12:00:00", latitude=28.6139, 
                  longitude=77.2090, timezone="Asia/Kolkata")

# Initialize the Lal Kitab calculator
lk = LalKitabCalculator(chart)

# Get planetary positions in Lal Kitab format
lk_positions = lk.get_planetary_positions()
for planet, house in lk_positions.items():
    print(f"{planet} is in House {house}")

# Check for sleeping planets
sleeping_planets = lk.get_sleeping_planets()
for planet in sleeping_planets:
    print(f"{planet} is sleeping in House {sleeping_planets[planet]}")

# Get planetary debts (Rinanubandhana)
debts = lk.get_planetary_debts()
for debt_type, planets in debts.items():
    print(f"{debt_type} Debt: Affected by {planets}")

# Get Lal Kitab remedies for each planet
for planet in ["Sun", "Moon", "Mars", "Mercury", "Jupiter", "Venus", "Saturn", "Rahu", "Ketu"]:
    remedies = lk.get_remedies(planet)
    print(f"\nRemedies for {planet}:")
    for remedy in remedies:
        print(f"- {remedy.description} (Effectiveness: {remedy.effectiveness})")
        print(f"  When to perform: {remedy.timing}")

# Calculate current Lal Kitab dasha
current_dasha = lk.get_current_dasha()
print(f"\nCurrent Lal Kitab Dasha: {current_dasha.planet} until {current_dasha.end_date}")
print(f"Favorable planets during this period: {current_dasha.favorable_planets}")
print(f"Challenging planets during this period: {current_dasha.challenging_planets}")

# Get lucky factors
lucky = lk.get_lucky_factors()
print(f"\nLucky numbers: {lucky.numbers}")
print(f"Lucky colors: {lucky.colors}")
print(f"Lucky days: {lucky.days}")
print(f"Lucky direction: {lucky.direction}")
```
